# Matplotlib_Challenge

## Overview
We have received some data on a recent animal study from the fictitious pharmaceutical company, Pymaceuticals. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens in treating a form of skin cancer.

## Objective
Use the mice meta-data and study results data we received and develop the findings to prepare, summarize, develop tables, and provide some observations for a report on the studyâ€™s results.

## Tools 
We completed the analysis with the following tools:
* Python
* Panda
* Matplotlib

## Accomplishments
* Combined both data sources and cleaned out any bad data.
* Generate a summary statistics table consisting of the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen.
* Developed plots to visually display the demographics of the mice in the study 
* Calculated the final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the most promising treatment regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin.
    * Calculated the quartiles and IQR, and quantitatively determine if there are any potential outliers across all four treatment regimens.
    * Used Matplotlib, to generate a box and whisker plot of the final tumor volume for all four treatment regimens
* Selected a mouse that was treated with Capomulin and generated a line plot of tumor volume vs. time point for that mouse.
* Generated a scatter plot of mouse weight versus average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment regimen.
* Calculated the correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment. 
    * Plot the linear regression model on top of the scatter plot.
